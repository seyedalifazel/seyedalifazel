### Hi, I am @seyedalifazel.ðŸ‘‹ An eager beaver boy who loves programming,financial markets trading, and new experiences.âš¡
In the world of programming, I preferred Laravel and Kotlin. But no matter what program we are going to develop only gives me enough time to become an expert in your subject and start. I faced investment challenges, addressed stock investment issues and various analyzes, and overcame them well. So, I am being a stock market analyst and forex trader, I just need a chart with my tools.
